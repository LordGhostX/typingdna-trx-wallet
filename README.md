# TypingDNA + Flask Demo

Demo showing how [TypingDNA](https://typingdna.com) can be used as 2FA to secure a Flask web application.

This is a [TypingDNA](https://typingdna.com) + Flask demo application showcasing how TypingDNA can be used for biometric 2FA to secure a Flask web application.

The `without-typingdna` directory contains only the user interface of the Flask application that will be implementing TypingDNA biometric 2FA.

The `with-typingdna` directory contains the full application (TypingDNA + Flask) that implements TypingDNA biometric 2FA.

You can also check this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/LordGhostX/8920f113da4c22467de45f9e38170092) that implements a TypingDNA API wrapper in Python.
